# Rooster-Rush
This is the code I wrote for my game "Rooster Rush." The objective of the game was to survive as long as possible, by avoiding all the obstacles.
Unfortunately this version is not playable, as it does not include needed classes, sprites, and sound files. (I did not create those assets so I did not want to upload them here.)



### If you REALLY want to try it:
Contact me at hello@jasoncodes.ca and I'll send you the game.
